Version Naming Standards
========================

Purpose
-------

   - All software developed, including software developed in the R&D prototype phase, should be tracked in source control.
   - The version numbers will track each software change.
   - Each change should be a deliberate change that can be tracked back to a design or product requirement.
   - The softwareâ€™s primary purpose is to encourage workflow, therefore lines of code should be treated like bolts in SolidWorks.
